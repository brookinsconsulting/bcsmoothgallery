============
WHAT IS IT ?
============

BC Smooth Gallery provides a quick and ready-to-run image gallery model.
It has several advantages over flash galleries.
- Images remains viewable if javascript is disabled.
- Images can be indexed by search engines.

It requires regular "Image" content class. With some customization, it can used with any content class that uses a image datatype.

Developped on Ezpublish 3.9.

Tested with Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox

Any feedback is welcome at the extension GitHUb Discussions.
