2) Run Package importer from admin interface and choose SmoothGallery package located in the extension
3) If you're not using regular CSS and JS inclusion in your <head></head>, you'll have to add the follwing lines in your pagelayout :

{* CSS Smoothgalery *}
<link rel="stylesheet" href={"stylesheets/smoothgallery/jd.gallery.css"|ezdesign} type="text/css" media="screen" />

{* JS Smoothgalery *}
<script src={"scripts/smoothgallery/mootools.js"|ezdesign} type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src={"scripts/smoothgallery/jd.gallery.js"|ezdesign} type="text/javascript"></script>

4) In order to test, create a "Galerie" content object. Add "Image" content objects as children of it.

Ready to run.
